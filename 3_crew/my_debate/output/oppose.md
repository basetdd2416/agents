While AI language models (LLMs) are often presented as beneficial tools, their development and deployment pose significant societal risks that outweigh their advantages. LLMs can perpetuate and amplify biases, misinformation, and extremist content, leading to social discord and mistrust in information sources. They also threaten privacy through their ability to generate personalized content, which can be exploited for manipulation or surveillance. Moreover, reliance on LLMs risks significant job displacement across sectors, exacerbating economic inequalities and social instability. Finally, their energy-intensive nature contributes to environmental degradation, undermining sustainability efforts. Given these profound concerns, it is clear that AI LLMs are not inherently beneficial for society and require cautious regulation and ethical oversight before their widespread adoption can be justified.
