**Unselected Companies:**

1. **LumeCube**
   - **Market Position & Future Outlook**: LumeCube is a leader in portable lighting for content creators. While it has a strong direct-to-consumer strategy and high growth potential due to the digital content boom, its niche focus limits its broader market impact.
   - **Investment Potential**: Though promising within its realm, compared to Figma, its market appeal and growth prospects are narrower given the specific audience. Investment returns may be more volatile with changing consumer tech trends.

2. **Boom Supersonic**
   - **Market Position & Future Outlook**: Recognized for innovation in supersonic travel, Boom Supersonic is progressing yet faces regulatory hurdles and isn’t publicly traded, making traditional investment strategies challenging.
   - **Investment Potential**: While it offers a visionary future for air travel and early investment opportunities via pre-IPO, the high risks with regulation and certification issues render it less secure than Figma's already-established market base.

3. **Synapse**
   - **Market Position & Future Outlook**: Synapse operates in fintech with AI-driven credit solutions and strategic partnerships, particularly in Asia Pacific.
   - **Investment Potential**: The company's innovative edge is promising amidst growing fintech trends. However, substantial competition and regulatory challenges make Synapse a riskier choice compared to Figma’s stable and expansive growth prospects.

4. **Notion**
   - **Market Position & Future Outlook**: As a productivity powerhouse, Notion integrates multiple functionalities in a single platform, attracting diverse users as digital collaboration grows.
   - **Investment Potential**: Notion holds substantial potential given its versatility. However, despite its wide-ranging applications, Figma's specialized focus on collaboration within the vital niche of design positions it better for stable, focused returns.

**Summary**

Figma was chosen due to its leading role in the growing market of design collaboration tools and the solid, ongoing user growth bolstered by the remote work movement. It offers a balanced investment profile with clear, specific market utility and competitive differentiation, reducing risk and maximizing growth potential in comparison to other candidates, which present higher uncertainty or narrower market scopes.
